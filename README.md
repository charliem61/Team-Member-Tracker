Goal/Motivation:

To create an application using SQL that allows non developers to interact with preloaded data about their employees. Each will have a manager, a salary, and a role. If this app were created for a buisness owner, they could view and manage each department, roles, and employees so that they could further organize and plan their business. 

Problems Solved:

The application solves all criteria asked in this homework. When the application is started the employer or business owner is presented with options to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, or update a an employee. 

After entering data the business is presented with a formatted table showing the department ids and department names, job titles, and role ids.

The Standouts:

The clean working functionality, the video displays the data entered in the table format once complete.

Challenges Faced:

Learning Sql. Creating the tables and formatting the ids and manager codes to match with the correct corresponding employee. 

Formatting and creating the schema file correctly to ensure capatilization was set up to flow correctly to the corresponding key.
